Fantome Theme for Ghost
=====================

Fantome powers my personal blog, [jeremy.hu](http://jeremy.hu). It could power your blog, too!

It's a simple theme, including some features you may find useful:
- Beautiful Syntax Highlighting
- Responsive video embeds
- Responsive everything, in fact!
- Google+ Comments

Installation
--------------

1. Clone the repository and upload the `fantome` directory to your Ghost blog's `content/themes` folder.
2. Add in your Social media profiles in `partials/social.hbs`, and in the `head` of `default.hbs`
3. Add in your Google Analytics UA tag in `default.hbs`
4. Go to the Settings page of the Ghost backend and select `fantome` from the Theme dropdown.
5. Restart Ghost
6. Enjoy!


Customization
-------------

Fantome supports Ghost's logo and cover image features, and will work perfectly fine with or without them. If you wish to upload a cover image, it will appear above the rest of the page. An uploaded logo replaces the textual blog name.

Fantome uses some awesome tools:

- **For Syntax Highlighting:** [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js)

To-Do
-----

- I'd like to make it easier to customize the theme by creating one single file to edit all your personal information.
